# test-php

You're an external partner, and need to save the shops we work with.

Create a controller or command to store the *Shop* details. You will need those for your application later on.
New shops are regularly being added to the API, so your system will have to request our API often to pull the updated data.

- Request the data from the route : https://www.leshabitues.fr/testapi/shops
- Parse the response and store the necessary content that a frontend developer will be using later on
- The *Shop* data can be updated in the futur (name, images, maxoffer, etc.), structure your code to plan any necessary updates of the entity.

## Rules to follow
- You must commit regularly so we can follow your progress with an initial empty commit when you start the test

## Deliverables

- The link to the git repository
- Several commits, with an explicit message each time
- A separate file or email documenting your process and principles you've followed
